## A React Native DatePicker

A demo implementation of a React Native DatePicker using constructor functions from [react-toolbox](http://www.react-toolbox.com) future [core implementation](https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/tree/agnostic-typescript). It is designed by [@evilrabbit](http://www.twitter.com/evilrabbit) from [zeit.co](http://www.zeit.co).

Another demo web version with styles from Airbnb is available [here](https://github.com/javivelasco/react-toolbox-airbnb). Both projects are developed as POC for React Toolbox Core factory functions.

It is a `create-react-native` app so it uses Expo under the covers. Run the project with:

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

Thanks to [@evilrabbit](http://www.twitter.com/evilrabbit) and [zeit.co](http://www.zeit.co) for the design.
